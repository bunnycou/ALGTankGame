# ALGTankGame
Tank Game for Spring 2024, CSET3150:001 Introduction to Algorithms

### Here is how to download your branch onto your computer using CLI commands
`git clone -b noah https://github.com/bunnycou/ALGTankGame`

Replace noah with your own name (collin, robby, xander)

Basic CLI git commands for updating your branch

This will add all files in the directory to be tracked in github
`git add .`

This will commit all changes and add a message, typically used to describe what changed.
`git commit -m "Updated files"`

This will push your changes to your branch, origin is the repository, name is your name/name of the branch
`git push origin name` or for example `git push origin noah` is what I would do

This will download your changes in case you work on multiple devices
`git pull origin name`

Your repository will contain a README.md file with this information, you can simply ignore it or delete it or update it, it will display on the github site with nice formatting (as you can see by going to https://github.com/bunnycou/ALGTankGame, the main branch has a README displaying)

The main branch will be used to create our final file which we will just do manually. 
This organization will allow us to all work independently and check what way of implementations we use so we can copy from each other and suggest improvements to others. 
You don't have to do just one file in your repository, you can do many and any files that you want in case you have other py files you use for testing or demonstration or text files that you want displayed.
